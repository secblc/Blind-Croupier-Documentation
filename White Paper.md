**Abstract:** Blind Crupier is a gambling software development company, prodiving decentralized, fair and  transparent gambling solutions for casinos working in the Ethereum blockchain.

Completely fair — a casino can't possibly gain any advantages except for those defined by specific game rules, including the fair random generation for cards, dices, roulette and slots.

Absolutely transparent — all the transactions, software source code, are open to the public and available for checking.

Decentralized — this guarantees that a player, obeying the game rules, will certainly receive his award (paid to his Ethereum wallet), independent of a casino's will.
