**Abstract:** Blind Crupier is a gambling software development company, prodiving decentralized, fair and  transparent gambling solutions for casinos working in the Ethereum blockchain.

**Completely fair** — a casino can't possibly gain any advantages except for those defined by specific game rules, including the fair random generation for cards, dices, roulette and slots.

**Absolutely transparent** — all the transactions, software source code, are open to the public and available for checking.

**Decentralized** — this guarantees that a player, obeying the game rules, will certainly receive his award (paid to his Ethereum wallet), independent of a casino's will.


## Introduction

The moment smart contracts emerged, the gambling industry changed forever. Casinos are becoming transparent and fair with their help. A player can easily check all the transactions, confirm the source code validity and check a casino's advantage in no time.

It's also obvious that the industry will not move forward to a new stage of online gambling until there is a complete solution, providing both a platform and games while taking advantage of smart contracts. We believe that the market drives the advance of technology, which, in turn, drives market growth.

This is what happened in [1994](http://www.rightcasino.com/news/history-of-online-casinos/), when Microgaming created the first online gambling software, starting a gold rush all over the world. 

Blind Crupier will open a new door in online gambling and provide all the tools necessary to start your own decentralized casino. We are sure that our solution will create a new start for the industry, and that our company will take the lead in this emerging market.

We have already done a tremendous job, starting from a general concept and ending up with a working beta-version of a video poker game. We have completely solved the problems of slow staking and fair, no oracle (An oracle is a third-party data supplier for a smart-contract, pseudo-random number generation).

This document shows how our products can solve the existing industry problems, which innovations we are introducing, what advantage our investors are going to receive and our current goals.
